# SlideQuest

SlideQuest is an iOS application where users are challenged to move a slider as close as possible to a target value. The closer the slider is to the target, the higher the user's score.

## Features

- **Target Challenge:** The app generates a random target value between 0 and 100. The user's goal is to move the slider to match this value as closely as possible.
- **Dynamic Scoring:** The score is calculated based on how close the slider is to the target value, with a maximum score of 100 points.
- **Interactive Slider:** The slider's thumb color dynamically changes based on the score, providing immediate visual feedback on the user's performance.
- **Replayability:** Users can reset the game to try and improve their score with a new random target.

## What I Learned

- **Custom UI Components:** Creating and integrating a custom slider using `UIViewRepresentable` in SwiftUI.
- **State Management:** Managing the state of UI elements and game logic within SwiftUI.
- **User Interaction:** Providing immediate feedback to users through dynamic UI changes and alerts.
- **Swift Development:** Leveraging Swift and SwiftUI to build interactive and engaging iOS applications.
